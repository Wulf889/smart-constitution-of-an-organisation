# Smart Constitution of an Organisation

## 📝 Project Description

The "Smart Constitution of an Organisation" is a blockchain-based governance tool that allows an organization to codify, manage, and update its constitution transparently using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## 🎯 Project Vision

To empower decentralized and semi-decentralized organizations with immutable, transparent, and verifiable governance rules that reduce conflicts, enforce trust, and promote efficient management.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Immutable Records**: The constitution is stored on-chain and can only be updated by verified board members.
- **Access Control**: Only designated board members can update the constitution.
- **Event Logs**: Updates to the constitution and changes in board member roles are transparently logged on-chain.

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Integration with a DAO framework for voting on constitutional amendments.
- Version control for historical tracking of all constitutional changes.
- Role-based permissions beyond board members (e.g., auditors, legal reviewers).
- User-friendly front-end interface for reading and proposing updates.
- Multi-signature approval process for sensitive changes.
